    <h1>Goal of this project: Bookmark Search Assistant</h1>
    <paragraph> Organize how information is presented to
        users to create a better framework for how
        we search. <br>
        <br>
        Create a Chrome extension to search through
        your archives in your bookmark, which tend to be websites or online resources one wishes to return to, visited
        beto remind users about that
        information before moving on to the next
        points of search and results. </paragraph>

    <h3> Relevant Reseaerch: Search Through Bookmarks</h3>
    <paragraph> Users commonly report problems in refinding important websites.
        To address this, some create Bookmarks (also called web
        Favorites) to improve the refinding of these websites. Previous
        research notes that these Bookmarks are rarely used. However,
        these prior studies did not systematically observe and quantify
        the frequency and success of Bookmark retrievals, or compare
        their success with other retrieval methods. The results suggest
        that unless the Bookmarks were highly visible, the participants did
        not use them. Furthermore, for websites that the users had visited,
        bookmarked websites were not better retrieved than those that
        had not been bookmarked.</paragraph>
