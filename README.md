# Bookmark Search Assistant Research Website

## Description
Welcome to the Bookmark Search Assistant Research Website! This site serves as a platform to share my Computer Science Research Seminar Project. This website shares the importance, problem, and resources I am using to complete my research. Whether you're a casual user looking to optimize your bookmarking strategy or a researcher interested in optimizing different aspects of the bookmarking function, this site aims to provide valuable insights and resources.

## Context
The idea for this website stemmed from a growing interest in the role of bookmarking in modern digital life. With the abundance of information available on the internet, efficient bookmarking has become essential for organizing and accessing relevant content. However, despite its widespread use, bookmarking practices vary widely among individuals, leading to questions about the most effective strategies. This website aims to address these questions by compiling research, tips, and tools related to bookmarking. Additionally, while I was beginning my research on this topic, I realized there were not many research articles available on the topic so having this platform can help someone else in the future looking into bookmarks. 

## Topic Selection
The topic of bookmark research was chosen due to its relevance and ubiquity in today's digital landscape. Almost every internet user engages in bookmarking to some extent, yet there's a lack of comprehensive resources dedicated to understanding and improving this practice. By focusing on bookmark research, this website aims to fill this gap and provide valuable insights for both casual users and researchers.
